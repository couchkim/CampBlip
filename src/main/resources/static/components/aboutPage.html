<p>I grew up as close friends with Marshall in elementary
    school.  When he told me he wanted to start a Lego
    camp, I thought it was a great idea.  I figured lots of
    kids would want to come because as a young child, I 
    always loved building Legos in my family room.  Camp 
    b.l.i.p. is an awesome experience for any kid who enjoys
    Legos and wants to have lots of fun.</p>
