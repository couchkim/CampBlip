        <h2>Marshall - Charlotte Latin School</h2>
        <p>We started with a two-day camp over Christmas break and have grown 
            into a multi-week summer camp. We have donated money and lego sets 
            to charities like the Levine Children's Hospital and the Susan G. 
            Komen Foundation.</p>

        <h2>Jack - Myers Park High School</h2>
        <p>I grew up as close friends with Marshall in elementary school. When he told me he wanted to start a Lego camp, I
            thought it was a great idea. I figured lots of kids would want to come because as a young child, I always loved
            building Legos in my family room. Camp b.l.i.p. is an awesome experience for any kid who enjoys Legos and wants
            to have lots of fun.</p>

        <h2>Charlotte - Charlotte Latin School</h2>
        <p>I joined Marshall's Lego camp 3 years after it started. When he first started the camp,
             all I wanted to do was be a counselor. I love building the Lego Friends sets and when 
             girls started going to b.l.i.p I was even more excited to be a counselor. 
             My favorite Friends sets are the Dolphin Cruiser, Jungle Bridge Rescue, and Summer Caravan.</p>

        <h2>Charlie - Charlotte Latin School</h2>
        <p>I was always a big Lego person and when Marshall decided he was going to start a Lego camp, 
            I knew I needed to go. I was a camper for the first 2 camps. Then, when I was 10, I convinced 
            my brother to let me be a counselor. I love being around the campers and being able to do 
            something I love while I'm at it.</p>
