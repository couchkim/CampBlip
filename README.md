# CampBlip

This is a web site for Camp Blip, a lego camp for elementary
school boys (and girls) started 5 years ago by 9-year-old, Marshall.

The primary scope of the project was to replace the paper-based catalogs of
almost 300 boxed Lego sets that are used during camp with a dynamic online version
that allows for indicating when a set has been checked in and out to a camper,
etc.  Campers can search by five different filters (name, set number, theme, 
skill level and availability status).

In addition, a pain point for counselors was making sure all the sets have
all of their pieces before a new camp season begins.  The new site provides
a list of all parts in a given set and the ability to indicate the inventory status
of each individual part.  This information makes it easy to note what missing pieces
need to be ordered, etc.
